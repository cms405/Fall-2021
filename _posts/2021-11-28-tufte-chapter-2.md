I was fascinated by what Tufte writes on page 49: that all the micro/macro designs presented in the chapter so far strained the limits of printing and the threshold of what the human eye registers. One advantage of such boundary-pushing visuals is to make the “information-thick worlds” (50) in which humans live accessible and manageable—or if not manageable, then measurable. Every window in the chapter’s opening New York map example can be visually registered and counted, if one were so inclined. Even someone who looked out at that self-same view from some imagined skyscraper window all their lives could not aggregate the data of windows’ number and position. If visual memory is weak, as Tufte says, then these micro/macro examples present memory condensed, all present at once—and somehow making that vast amount of simultaneous information intuitively readable.
