I had not thought about how both art and writing, two practices with fundamentally same aims were so separated in both practices today. We take it as a given that writers and artists are different. Although both dedicated to the pursuit of communication and tapping into our shared human experience, these disciplines are often viewed isolated pursuits rather than ones that are intertwined. For the concrete poetry design project, this reading has lead me to think more deeply about how to develop a dialectical relationship between the words of the poem and the fonts and design that I choose. Rather than simply choosing design elements which relate to the poem, I will consider how these design elements can have meaning in their own right equal in significance with the words of the poem.
