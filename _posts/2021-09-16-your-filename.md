McCloud explains in chapter 2 how the simplicity of icons makes them easier for people to understand and relate to. People can  more easily relate to conceptual characters/images, and less to more realistically drawn characters, because it lies within the world of concepts, in which people’s identities also exist. it more closely resembles the conceptual idea of themselves. One interesting point that McCloud makes that I had never thought about before is how we never truly see our own faces. When we tell our faces to make a particular expression, we don’t know exactly what we look like, but only have a vague sense of our expression based on the other people around us. 

One idea I found quite interesting in chapter 5 is how an image can take on symbolic meaning the more it is used, in the same way that written language was developed over time. He gives the example of visible smoke lines being used to depict fumes from a trash can, and how everyone can understand what these wavy lines mean even though they do not exist in real life, since the trash smell wafts upward in a similar way to the smoke. I also thought it was very interesting how the Japanese evolved different symbols for various expressions that other cultures may not understand or even recognize, because these symbols were developed in isolation from other cultures.
