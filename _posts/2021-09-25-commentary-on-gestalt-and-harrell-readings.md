From looking through the Gestalt website, it was interesting to think about the different visual habits that we have. Oftentimes, humans naturally perceive things a certain way and it was fascinating to see how Gestalt psychology's 6 laws explained it. I think that this is also extremely important to keep in mind as we create designs since people will view designs with their built-in view/natural tendencies.
