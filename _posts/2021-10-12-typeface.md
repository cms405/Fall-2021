I appreciate the author's approach in using familiar images to illustrate the idea and meaning behind typography. The author clearly described the distinction between practicality and aesthetics. This reading is an excellent example of why a typeface is an essential element of a successful users experience (UX) in any domain. As a not-experienced typefaces designer, I often find myself looking at the fonts used in similar products when building products. Another critical aspect of choosing fonts is the information hierarchy on pages. Titles are more legible given their sizes, so there is more space for designers to use whimsical typefaces. However, content should be a more readable font as the size is much smaller.

In this example, we notice the use of two typefaces. The details of thee even are written using the more legible typeface.
