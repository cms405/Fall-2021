Macro design allows the viewer to have more freedom of interpretation, taking in an overall theme, concept, or data set that is conveyed well and easily understood (arranging blocks of text in a specific shape could be an example of this). The micro elements of the design are what allow the reader to dive deep into the nuances of the piece and have a more personalized and rich experience of the information presented (for example, using different textures, fonts, or clarifying text). If used together, these can make a design multi-leveled, profound, and complex; easy to navigate yet detailed and thorough.

One of the examples of effective use of micro/macro design that I found really interesting was the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C From a far, this piece looks like a black long wall with grey texture, however, when you look up close, you can discern the names of the dead soldiers that lost their lives during the Vietnam war. Both of these combine to display both the magnitude of the deceased and the individuality and value of each fallen soldier.
