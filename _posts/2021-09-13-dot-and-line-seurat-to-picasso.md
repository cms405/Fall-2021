## A New Post

A dot is neither exciting nor revolutionary. As Dondis investigates, the dot exists like an atom: it’s the simplest building block of visual statement. However, like the atom’s ability to combine and create something exhilarating, dots can also collaborate. Our reading briefly mentions Seurat; his work took this notion to a novel level. By combining a large sum of dots by tightly packing them together, he accomplished creating a full scene. Dondis explores how dots can lead the eye based on varying thickness and whitespace. Seurat takes advantage of minimum whitespace, approximately equal dot sizing, and color overlay to create recognizable scenery. By exclusively utilizing dots, Seurat allows for a softness in the painting. Although the subjects do have obvious shapes, their outlines aren’t sharply cut by lines. Instead, this technique allows  for almost a glow or haze around the scene, contributing to the carefree summery feel of the setting. In the same way a molecule can only form from a collection of varying atoms, this painting can only have the affect it does due to the plethora of tightly packed basic building structures: dots.

Moving from chemistry to physics, any introductory calculus or physics course will describe a vector as having magnitude and direction. Dondis similarly describes a line as possessing definitive direction and purpose. Despite their basic nature, the author delves into how lines can be personal or apathetic, indecisive or bold. Picasso’s line drawings capture these sentiments quite well. The varying thickness of the line appears doodle-esque, bringing about an air of interpersonal doodle-esque-ness. Without lifting the utensil to break the singular line, the artist brought movement and shape to the work. This approach draws onlookers in due to the decisive start and stop to the line (and subsequent figure). By tracing the depiction in our mind, we subconsciously follow the movement and dance of the figures.
