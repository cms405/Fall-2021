When Dante's "Inferno" was mentioned, a parody came to mind. What if there are faux pas at MIT that result in a ring of the Inferno? Could spilling coffee down the Infinite during rush hour put you in the first ring? Maps of the poem elicit attention because they depict a physical place that is theoretical for many. Dante puts great detail to the concrete look of each ring and clearly describes Hell going into the earth (as seen in the maps attached). It's this combination of physical and author-imagined that allows for great creativity within the confounds of something familiar. ![Michelangelo_Caetani_Cross_Section_of_Hell_1855_Cornell_CUL_PJM_1071_04.jpeg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Michelangelo_Caetani_Cross_Section_of_Hell_1855_Cornell_CUL_PJM_1071_04.jpeg)
