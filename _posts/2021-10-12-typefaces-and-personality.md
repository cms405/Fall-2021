In the font-to-shoe matching puzzle, I matched 4 of the 6 fonts to the same shoes as Spiekermann, but the remaining two fonts I felt had different styles from what Spiekermann chose. It’s interesting that in general, people can agree on the “personality” of a font, but certain fonts can still evoke different feelings from different people. A designer can never be sure what feelings the viewer will have from the font they have chosen, and can only base it off past uses of the font and their own opinions. There are general associations made with each classification of typefaces, for example, serif fonts are reminiscent of newspapers and old-school print styles, while script fonts are more quirky and pleasant. However, even within the various typeface classifications, there is still so much room for variation: a more regular script typeface can feel polished and fancy, while a more handwritten-style script typeface feels more casual.
