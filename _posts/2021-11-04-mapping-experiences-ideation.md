title: Mapping Experiences Ideation
author: Hayley Ye

I’m very interested in mapping food attractions around the city, perhaps local to MIT’s campus or the Boston/Cambridge area. Within the map, it would show information such as type of cuisine, pricing, ratings, aesthetic, etc.

Another idea I have for the mapping experiences project is to map unique sights and experiences around MIT. This idea is heavily inspired by the book On Looking by Alexandra Horowitz, which describes the same walk around a neighborhood of Manhattan from 11 different perspectives. Each person notices different things, which I think would be really interesting and unique things to map out.
