## Infinity Dots (Midsummer)

![kusama.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/kusama.png)

This painting called "Infinite Dots" by Yayoi Kusama uses lots of black dots of various sizes with different spacing on a yellow background.
As the dots get smaller and closer together, the string of dots appear to resemble lines curved in various directions. The eye doesn't really have a center of gravity and there is a sense of movement as your eye keeps looking around. The many lines of dots effectively communicate Kusama's personal obsession and hallucinations with infinity and dots.
