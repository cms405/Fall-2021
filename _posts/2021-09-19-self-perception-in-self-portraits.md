In Jason Farago's article, he first concentrated on the self-portrait from 1500 by Dürer. Farago brought up major points of the self-portrait and how that conveyed a certain feeling and sense of reality. Dürer used techniques such as symmetry, shading, and texture to create an impression to the viewer's senses. But beyond the experience for others, Dürer's self-portrait was a representation of how he viewed himself. It carries a development from his earlier self-portraits and shows his evolution as he ages. I found it interesting how Farago discussed that self-portraits were fairly uncommon and that Dürer created self-portraits at a much higher frequency than many other artists. He was regularly observing himself and thinking of how to translate his view of himself into an art work. Dürer was percieving himself and he adapted his portraits as his view changed. With the body positioning of the self-portrait from 1500, Dürer created a change from his previous works and it signified a change in his self-perception.
