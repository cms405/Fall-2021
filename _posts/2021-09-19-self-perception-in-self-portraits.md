In Jason Farago's article, he first concentrated on the self-portrait from 1500 by Dürer. Farago brought up major points of the self-portrait and how that conveyed a certain feeling and sense of reality. Dürer used techniques such as symmetry, shading, and texture to create an impression to the viewer's senses. But beyond the experience for others, Dürer's self-portrait was a representation of how he viewed himself. It carries a development from his earlier self-portraits and shows his evolution as he ages.
