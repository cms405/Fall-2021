The Law of Pr√§gnanz both affirms and contradicts our class discussion from last week. We discussed how often the word"satisfying" appears with well-balanced and symmetrical designs. However, many in the class also contend that an assymetrical shape can better excite and delight onlookers. As an audience, we almost crave an unexpected symmetry. Although we feel more satisfied with a perfectly alligned form, we don't want to come accross as bored or catered to. The Law of Continuation permeates into scientific forms as well as graphic designs. An increasing trend in the scientific community seems to be the use of R-related programming to make continuous and curvier (versus sharper-edged) lines in scientific journal papers. Although we may not initially connect technical writing with Gestalt Psychology, we can see that these laws emerge in a plethora of arenas within our engineering-filled lives.
