Hi! My name is Tiffany and I'm from Westminster, California, which is near Disneyland and one hour from LA! Fun fact: in high school, I was voted "Advanced Procrastinator" for my senior superlative! I might still hold this title amongst my friends. My hobbies include reading books and webcomics, watching TV shows, exploring Boston, listening to music, dancing, singing, acting, coding, and hanging out with friends.

I'm currently a senior at MIT in course 6-2 (EECS - Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). I love coding and I hope that I can inspire others to explore STEM, particularly tech and computer science. I am taking CMS.405 because I would like to explore design to improve the UI/UX of software applications I make, and I also need this for my potential CMS minor. My website can be found here: https://tyffic.al. I hope to become a better designer through this class! :)
