Tiffany Trinh is a senior at MIT majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and potentially minoring in Comparative Media Studies. She loves coding and hopes to inspire others to explore STEM, particularly tech and computer science. She is taking CMS.405 to explore design and improve the UI/UX of software applications she makes. Her website can be found here: [tyffic.al](https://tyffic.al "Tiffany Trinh's Website"). :)

Tiffany is from Westminster, California, which is near Disneyland and one hour from LA! Fun fact: in high school, she was voted "Advanced Procrastinator" for her senior superlative! She might still hold this title amongst her friends. Her hobbies include reading books and webcomics, watching TV shows, exploring Boston, listening to music, dancing, singing, acting, coding, and hanging out with friends.
