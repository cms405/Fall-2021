For my revision, I decided to change the layout entirely so that it would resemble a more recent Robinhood ad, as shown below. I also made the color and font (Avenir) more consistent. I would've liked to use white text still, but I could only find the logo in green or black, so I opted for black for readability. I also added the certain limitations apply text as well as the collusion url because I felt that it fit the idea well. I included a somewhat transparent Gamestop logo on the money being handed over to reference the Gamestop fiasco of early 2021 as well.
