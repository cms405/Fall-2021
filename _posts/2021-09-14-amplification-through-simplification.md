The concept that stood out to me most in chapter two of Understanding Comics was that of masking. The idea that through simplification one can identify more with pictures and symbols rather than with a more realistic or detailed representation. Seeing yourself in cartoons or comics is a universal experience because the elements incorporated have less detail. This makes them more recognizable as a concept rather than a specific version of whatever it represents. An interesting example that was brought up in the chapter was that of the sword. A simple version of a sword can be considered an extension of the character that possesses it, but, if the designer wants to represent it as something foreign, the act of adding more detail “others” the object so that it becomes less of a concept and more of an actual sword that is unique and exists.
In terms of chapter five, I really enjoyed the explanation of how lines carry expressive potential and can serve as visual metaphors. Just the direction, width, or texture of a line can deliver meaning to the viewer and evoke certain emotions. These subtle details like curves, ragged edges, and sharp turns help emphasize the tone the designer wishes to portray.
