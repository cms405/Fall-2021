In the passage, Barthes discusses the philisophical underpinnings of photography as having deeper roots than that of simply capturing a moment in time, the act of capturing a photograph having significant influence over the consciousness of the "spectator" distinct from the photo's subject and photographer. Barthes terms two core elements of photography: studium, the relationship between the photograph and the context in which it was captured and puntum, the personal relationship with the prospective observer. The discussion in these last chapters reminded me of Andy Warhol's work in reprinting photographs. I had always thought these pieces of work to be quite unrefined and meaningless. What is there to be gained from a series of soup cans? However, throughout this reading, I thought about how these photographs were so impactful due to how distinctly present studium and punctum were. Studium in highlighting such an iconic commodity as the Campbell's soup can and cementing it in a point in time and punctum in how these commodities are so pervasive in our personal lives that they inadvertently become a part of our individual consciousness.

The series of photos evoked almost a sense of otherworldliness in immersing the spectator immediately in a narrative Gerz crafted related to the photo. However, the associated texts did not simply describe the photo, but positioned it as a snapshot in time of a broader story occuring in the background. Some of the works of the French wall I found to be a bit confounding, especially the first couple of ones, which were more abstrac. However, I found the last couple to be similarly  intriguing as the text spun a story with no premise as if capturing a narrative in a moment in time, similar to the function of photographs.
