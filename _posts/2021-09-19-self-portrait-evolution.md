Seeing Dürer’s development through his self-portraits over time was the most compelling part of this piece for me. While it is obvious that the quality of the art would improve over time, what really strikes me is the way it seems like he captures his personality shifting over time. While his teenage self-portrait seems withdrawn and timid, he seems to grow in confidence and stature over the years until he depicts himself in a regal outfit with a pose inspired by artistic depictions of Jesus. It feels very human to see the artist gain confidence and stature using a medium that people today feel so strongly familiar with, and gives us a strong tie to the past. While people taking selfies don’t assign as much significance to simply taking a picture, the pose and clothing the person is wearing can often provide a similar framing as the Dürer pieces, showing changes in personality and self-image over time. The Dürer paintings make clear how every choice brings its own meaning to a self-portrait, as depicting yourself is an intimate and vulnerable experience.
