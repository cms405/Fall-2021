In this updated version, I animated the scene to tell the story of the text. I started by prototyping the flow of the animation on Powerpoint, which was a great prototyping tool! I noticed that moving all fish looked cluttered and confusing, so I decided to keep the main fish in place with "breathing like" animation.
At first, I used Adobe Animate. It was not a success. My composition contained more text than "characters," and I needed a tool to give me more control over transitions and text animation. 

I then switched to Adobe After Effects. I created multiple layers for each movement in the scene. For the first line of the poem, I chose to animate it as a wave or an eel swimming to provide a preview before the main characters arrive! The top fish group each had its own path of motion that aligned with each other.
I then showed the two main fish with the text, followed by another group of fish joining the scene. The idea is to emphasize that there is plenty of fish in the sea! The second group of the fish cross path to emphasize togetherness and love.

The colors are black and white. I intend to reflect the design of a script on paper, which tells a story by showing the reader through shaping and animating words.
