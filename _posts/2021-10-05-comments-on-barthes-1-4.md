Throughout these 4 chapters, Barthes seeks to find the true description of photography. It was interesting to see how Barthes walked through his analysis of what photography truly is. His attempt at classifying photography exposed the disorder of what photography is or can be, but one point that he raised was how photographs are rarely ever separately perceived from its referent (ie. what it represents). What does a photograph do? It is both infinitely reproduceable and a singular moment. Barthes also says photographs are invisible as the referent adheres to the photograph. We find it difficult to separate ourselves away from what the photograph represents to actually view the photograph as itself. One thing I contemplated however when I read the section where Barthes discusses his inner conflict about photograhy (pg. 7 of the reading) was whether we really need to separate the referent from the photograph. In a sense, I realized it is people's automatic reaction to take the referent first. It is interesting to realize how someone perceives photography depending on their role as photographer, audience, or subject.
