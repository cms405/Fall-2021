The techniques for visual communication that Dondis describes in chapter 6 are all quite interconnected and related. For instance, the opposition between symmetry and asymmetry is very similar to that of balance and instability. Symmetric designs are often well-balanced, while asymmetric ones can feel unstable. Yet at the same time, there are many asymmetric designs that are still balanced. I am often most attracted to asymmetric and balanced designs because the asymmetry creates intrigue and draws me in, while the balance makes it such that the asymmetry is not unsettling and uncomfortable.
