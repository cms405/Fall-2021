From our reading this week, I would like to reflect on the design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. At first glance, it's just a list of soldier names, but the more I understand the concept, the more I love it! It is an excellent example of how to depict micro and macro details. The macro story is manifesting in the massive structure of the memorial. That vast number of names shows the soldiers that this country had lost in a war. The extended design depicts the duration of the war and the chronological order in which these men were lost. As a visitor, walking along the structure reminds us of time and how many soldiers were lost during the duration of the war. For a macro experience, visitors get to read the names of those soldiers, connect with them and relate to the time they lost their lives. I saw many photos of families pointing at the names of their lost ones and connecting with that memorial. It serves as a living structure of the cost of wars, but also, some people feel proud for the sacrifice their loved ones made for their country.

Other aspects that contributed to the macro experience of the memorial are the locations and material used. The site is close to other essential monuments giving this structure significance. In addition to that, the material is shiny and reflective, reflecting the other important structures nearby, making them part of the design. I also feel the reflection of visitors on the stones when mirco reading the list provides a personal experience and connection that is special to each visitor.
