title: Subversive Ad Update - Ali
---
I reverted back to one of my earlier designs that I felt was more ad-like than my previous draft, which imitated the Netflix interface and felt too convoluted and text-heavy. Instead, I imitated an actual Netflix ad’s layout and used one of their early taglines: “Anywhere. Anytime. Instantly.” I opposed the text and the subject of the image—Ted Bundy—to create a balanced composition. The ad’s subversiveness does rely mostly on the audience’s recognition of the famous serial killer—which would make the ad additionally impactful for consumers more likely to recognize a famous serial killer from, say, a slew of documentaries. Netflix churns out crime documentaries—on-demand depictions of trauma, abuse, and murder that nevertheless find eager audiences that keep that content in demand. Just in case Bundy isn’t recognizable, the viewer can also be clued into the ad’s subversive nature by the small URL at the bottom of the ad: Netflix.com/bodycount. My hope is that the ad balances a familiar layout and typeface with subtlety and accusation. The cycle of supply and demand enabled by the platform for exploitative true crime, albeit with a slick and modern presentation, is the target for this ad.
