Something that resonated with me while reading the chapter Image World from Susan Sontagâ€™s work On photography is how we take photography these days for granted. The fact that photographs are the only window for me to see how my grandparents looked like, how life was before and compared to how it is now, how people from other places look like. All this is information that we would have never received without the help of photography is now ubiquitous and easily accessible. It is also interesting to observe how democratizing photography is. In the past, only a few from a particular class were able to have a portrait. Now everyone and anyone can enjoy taking and sharing photographs (see image bellow).

Photography provides us with a more accurate representation of reality!
