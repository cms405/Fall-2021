When I first brainstormed for this assignment, the first thing that came to mind was the controversy surrounding Goya when its CEO praised Trump, thereby causing major backlash from the Hispanic community for ignoring all of the derogatory statements Trump has made about immigrants and Latinos.

To represent this theme, I wanted to stack the Goya cans in a way that would resemble a wall, like Trump’s wall bordering Mexico. To add contrast, I colorblocked the opposing sides of the wall with colors similar to the blue and red for democratic and republican party respectively.

Since Goya is one of the biggest Hispanic brands, they usually have their slogans in both Spanish and English to reach their target audience. I tried to do the same, even taking a slogan that was used for Goya’s Hispanic Heritage Month promotion: “A tribute to the taste of home.” I wanted to play on those words since they inspire very different feelings than “Go back to where you came from” which is a phrase commonly used by Trump and his supporters against immigrants.

Finally, I decided to keep it quite minimal and with vibrant colors since that is what is most common for Goya’s advertisements.
