One aspect about self-portraits that Jason Farago highlights in his article is the fact that they are a historical development; they were invented and not self-evident. The meaning behind the very first self-portraits had never crossed my mind before reading this article. For example, I had not wondered what it meant for someone to deem themselves worthy of being depicted and brave enough to develop such depiction, thus, becoming the author of their own life story. Albrecht DÃ¼rer was very self-aware and clear on the power his creative uniqueness held. The way he identified all of his works with his monogram illustrates a sense of confidence and ownership over his intellectual property and overall presence. I think we can all benefit from taking more ownership and pride in ourselves so that we can represent our essence more clearly.
