In chapter 6 of "Understanding Comics", the four types of text and picture combinations that interested me the most were: interdependent, word-specific, picture-specific, and montage.

In interdependent combinations, pictures and text work together to form a more cohesive and thorough understanding of the character’s feelings, like an internal monologue. I very much appreciate the fact that the combination of pictures and text creates a message that, as the author describes it, “neither could have conveyed alone.”

In word-specific combinations, the pictures bring the reader’s attention towards a certain aspect of the text by emphasizing specific fragments of a scene. This method allows more attention to detail in the story through a pictorial zoom-like effect of whatever is being described.

In picture-specific combinations, the words serve as a soundtrack to the pictures in the scene. This creates almost the same effect as a movie or video format, encouraging the reader to think about the sounds and images being portrayed.

In montage combinations, words are essential to the picture composition. There is certain liberty to this style, given that the author can experiment more with the orientation, boldness, and movement of the text. Instead of keeping text and picture as separate elements, they meld together to form a different experience for the reader.
