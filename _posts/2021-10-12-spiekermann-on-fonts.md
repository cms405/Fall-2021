I really enjoyed how the book used its own typesetting and font choices to demonstrate the points it was trying to make. I think Spiekermann did a really good job showing how different fonts serve different purposes and connote different emotions. In terms of practicality, I think one issue I've often had with fonts is that the defaults that come with a lot of programs are either hard to search through or not actually that distinct. Though the book provides many good examples, I wish it had gone more into the details of how designers actually find and select fonts, as it seems like even with the broad font classifications Spiekermann provided, it would take far too long to search through all the fonts in one of those groupings to find the one that suits your design best. One of the uses of a font that most stands out to me is Facebook's logo, which is either the whole word or just the f from the logo, and the fact that it's so distinct and they kept it so long shows that simplicity and a good font choice has longevity. Interestingly, it seems like it's not fully a font of its own, and was developed fully in house, though sources say it's most similar to Klavika Bold. Thus, as with many things, this good design was custom tweaked to fit its purpose as well as possible.
