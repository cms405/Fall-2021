From Chapter 2, I found McCloud's comments about the differences between the character and environment intriguing. By seeing the juxtaposition of the realistic background with the iconic character, it translates a contrast between the two. The simplicity of the character allows viewers to easily relate to them and fill in the gaps in order for the character to "become" like ourselves. On the other hand, the realistic background does the work for the viewer and the viewer can feel like they experience everything through the character. It is interesting to see how iconic characters are structured to be more relatable and reach an audience that seeks to experience through the character.

In Chapter 5, McCloud discusses the usage of symbols to convey the invisible. It is interesting to see how certain symbols are now immediately recognizable as certain actions, feelings, thoughts, etc. Although some symbols are specific to certain cultures, people undeniably pick up on symbols and learn them. These combinations of lines, dots, and shapes become a descriptor; something for viewers to understand and relate to. We give them meaning and although it is not something we see in real life, it provides a visual concept.
