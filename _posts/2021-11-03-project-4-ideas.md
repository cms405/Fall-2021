title: Project 4 Ideas

For this next project, I am thinking of trying to map out an experience based around food in China or major cities in Asia. In general, I am interested in incorporating culture/history into my map, but I am open to thinking of other ideas (could be more straightforward or more abstract). For the dimensions of my experience, I am planning on visualizing the diversity of the experience and its personal touches. My data sourcees for my mapping idea are linked here: [Four Major Cuisines in China](http://www.cits.net/china-travel-guide/four-major-cuisines-in-china.html), [Rice Theory - North/South differences](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140508141743.htm), and [Regional Cuisines](http://www.kas.ku.edu/archived-site/chinese_food/regional_cuisine.html). There are many more online sources that I can find once the project idea is more set. Some possible inspirations are more illustrative, cartoon designs like the one below.
