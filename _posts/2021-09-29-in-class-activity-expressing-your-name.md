I missed this in class activity so I'm just posting the fonts I chose here.

1. I think I'm pretty thoughtful but I often have decision paralysis with even with the most minor decisions, so I like to sketch things out such that I can always erase, change, and modify things if I need, just like this font. Additionally, the font still a work in progress and will be continually refined in the future, which is also true of myself.

2. I think my lifestyle is pretty simple and I find joy in the ordinary day to day things like taking walks and cooking. Even the clothes I wear are simple in my opinion (though sometimes, I appreciate when one detail is just a little bit elevated, similar to the fancy g in this font.)

3. I really value authenticity and honesty. I think this font, with its handwritten quality, really captures that idea and is similar to how I would genuinely write my name. Also, the script is quite fluid and I think that represents that I'm generally understanding/flexible and open hearing other people's thoughts.
