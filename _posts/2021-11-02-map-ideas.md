title: Map ideas

For this upcoming design project, I had the idea to work on a map that is more “cartoonish”, colorful, and interactive. Here is an example of the Rio 2016 Olympics where they created an interactive map of the Olympic site.

In terms of what I would map, an idea I had was to make a map of the MIT campus but through the perspective of the student experience, highlighting things like the Banana Lounge or Stud 5. Another idea would be to make a map of Boston with a similar approach.
I’m open to working on things related to culture and vibrancy as well or maybe on the more mythical side, perhaps for a children audience. It would be cool to create a creative learning experience map, maybe something that would appear in an interactive installation at a children’s museum.

Here is another example of a map I liked of San Francisco.
