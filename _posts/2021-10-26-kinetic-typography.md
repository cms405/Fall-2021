Van Leeuwen and Djonov, in their essay, pursue a historicized sense of kinetic typography and its technicalities in how kinetic typography achieves its effects. Their opening description of kinetic typography is almost synesthetic, with an impressionistic sense of verbal tone conveyed by, for instance, color contrast. However, they very explicitly pin down shortly afterward that they had had a similar theory about smell and impressionistic, individualistic experience—only to realize that smell was in fact a structured “language” that was refined the organized by experts into units of organized meaning. The part of the essay I found especially impactful was the discussion of technical guidance and limitations as being in the hands of software developers. This analysis felt borderline Latourian—ie, users are trained into behavior by technology. (I also found it a little funny that in talking about technicalities and constraints, the journal editors couldn’t decide if they believed in the Oxford comma or not.) The boundaries of such an artform of kinetic typography coincide with technical boundaries, in a way that calligraphy never would (outside of obeying traditional forms). But those boundaries also help to define the evolving set of meanings that can be transmitted and understood through experimentation and repetition.
