Farago mentions that Durer never made prints of his 1500 self portrait or showed it to the public in any exhibitiion, meaning that the self portrait was created for his own viewing and purposes. It’s interesting how Durer depicted himself in his self portrait not as how others saw him or not necessarily realistically, but to show the way he saw himself. Perhaps it is Durer’s ideal version of himself painted aspirationally, or perhaps Durer was just a narcissist.
