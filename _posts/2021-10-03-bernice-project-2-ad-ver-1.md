For my project 2 design, I concentrated on the issue of fur in fashion products. I wanted to approach my design in a way that still followed the fashion advertisement style while also providing a slight implication toward the true ethics behind certain fashion items.

The first consideration I had when designing this advertisement was the style of image. Images are important in fashion advertisements, so I wanted to select an editorial style image that centralizes on featuring the item of clothing. Oftentimes, the background is plain in fashion editorial photoshoots, so I selected a simple background with a model wearing a fur coat. The next strategy that influenced my design was color. Instead of using various colors, I kept my design in grayscale. Black and white is often used in fashion labeling and magazines, so I felt it was effective to use it as a way to call attention to the shape instead of the vibrancy. The brand Yves Saint Laurent also uses black and white in many of its advertisements, so this was a way to remain consistent with the overall brand style. For the overall layout, I was mainly inspired by other fashion advertisements and how they enlist the use of white space to direct attention to the model and clothing. The minimal text and simple font style conveys the simplicity of everything else compared to the clothing. I chose to place small text at the bottom left corner since fashion magazines often have captions to photos at the corners of the page.

For the imagery, I selected images of a model wearing a fur coat and a mink. I placed these photos in the same frame in order to present a juxtaposition of the live animal with the animal product. This reminds consumers that products do not just start out the way they look. Products are sourced from other materials or “things” that mean more than just an object to wear. Having the presence of both brings out both the similarities and differences so that the viewer realizes the impact of fur clothing on animals.
