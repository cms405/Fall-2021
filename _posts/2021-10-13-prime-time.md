For my revision, I honed in on the objectification of female reporters. Instead of an ad for a station, this advertisement promotes a specific show. Barbara Milicent Roberts is Barbie's full name, and I used "Prime Time" to not only mirror current show names on-air, but allude to how women in news must look their prime. Instead of the stock background of a city, this background is a layer of real-reported images taken this year during conflicts. A rose-colored film is applied to insinuate how we can put our rose-colored glasses on and focus more on the beauty of a reporter rather than the news. The barbie style transfer using convolutional layers is still utilized.
