In the reading, Prof. Harrell claims that representation mappings to different semiotic spaces imbues distinct meaning to signs. This conjecture is crucial to the practice of subjective computing which seaks to manifest the holistic experience of individuals in the physical world into the digital realm. An example of this is the use of parody, a common artistic technique which becomes a form of semiotic morphism through subversion of often well-recognized signs or symbols to convey subjective meaning. Below, is a parody of the famous painting the Mona Lisa. Lauded as perhaps one of the greatest works of the exalted Leonardo Da Vinci, defacing the familiar piece with features of the Joker, a modern-day cultural icon, emphasizes the message of irreverance for established power structures and convention associated with the Joker.

The ability to personalize social media profiles is also an example of semiotic morphism as users are able to change the representation mappings of their profile picture, biography, feed, etc. to express their individual characteristics and dictate how they choose to present themselves digitally.
