In Dondis Chapter 6, I found it interesting to see how content and form interacted along with the artist and audience. Dondis presents multiple visual techniques and pairs them up to show the two sides of these design principles. The four techniques that appealed to me were balance/instability, simplicity/complexity, understatement/exaggeration, and activeness/stasis. I found these techniques interesting since they often are components that I consider when I create designs. It is amazing to see how each technique can convey a different meaning to an audience based on whether I choose one side or the other (ie. simple design vs. complex design). I have also realized that often, I tend to prefer certain sides of a technique more than the other.

Balance provides a sense of satisfaction and completion, which is often a dependable design component. However, instability offers surprises and can create more interesting designs. In a similar fashion, simplicity can be eyecatching in a calm way and it centers on a main focal point. Complexity can be visually stimulating, but there is less of a focus on one specific aspect. Understatement is subdued and more of an implication, which can speak to the audience and allow them to develop ideas that are guided by the artist's design. Exaggeration allows boldness and is immediately obvious to the viewer though, which offers an alternative that directly communicates with the audience. Activeness creates life to a design, conveying something that is not truly "moving". Stasis brings the viewer into the frame, which allows a sense of peace and singularity.
