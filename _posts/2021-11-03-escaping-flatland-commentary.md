Tufte presents the different approaches to using flatland visualizations through various examples. One of the examples that first caught my attention was Kellom Tomlinson's "The Art of Dancing". This example used realistic perspective to extend out of the bounds of flatland design. However, it also mixed in multiple depictions of movement: one way was the anatomical movement of the figures themselves and the other was the line path of where the figures were going to move. I think this was one of the successes of this particular design since it adds dimensionality to a static, flat medium. I did find that the information carried by this design was slightly unclear though since the lines on the floor can be interpreted as scribbles. This design expects the viewer to understand the visual representation when in fact, it seems somewhat ambiguous without additional information.

Another example that was interesting was "Color Coordination", redrawn from Yumi Takahashi and Ikuyo Shibukawa. Here, colors were used as supplemental visual information, differentiating the shirts from each other. Although three-dimension isn't used in this design, the uniformity of shape and differences in color create an attractive design. This also allows the viewer to easily scan through the overall design and to attach onto the only difference: color.
