I was thinking about trying to make an experience that could visually serve as a timeline while representing something else. I was considering representing my journey from my house to our class everyday, mapping out Central and MIT, but using it to inform on a history of Visual Design. This is partially inspired by a map of science fiction I remembered from a while back that traced the lineage of science fiction in an abstract way, and various timelines I've seen with pictures that show different eras of visual design. I thought it would be cool to combine them into a more abstract experience that the user could interact with.
