In this excerpt from Tufte, we explore the different uses of color and how it holds information. It was interesting to learn about how best practices evolved based on the effectiveness of the design. Many of the best practices seemed to center around the idea of making something easy to process and creating a sense of balance. Examples like William Henry Toms after Thomas Badeslade, Chorographia Britannica or, **A Set of Maps of all the Counties in England and Wales . . .** (London, 1742), plate 18 and Thomas Badeslade, **A Compleat sett of Mapps of England and Wales in General, and of each County in particular . . .** (1724), pen and ink, and watercolor on vellum, leaf 35 (recto) contrasts various practices and highlights the development of effective color use and theory. In a way, this reading reflects our past reading by Dondis where color was discussed as something that could carry meaning and represented something. In the examples here, color is a carrier of information and depending on its application to the design, it can make it easier or harder for the audience to process the information. It was also interesting to explore the criteria of failure when using color, where generally, if colors overwhelm each other, it is a failure. Tufte discussed the importance of context for color as the way we view a color changes with its surroundings.
