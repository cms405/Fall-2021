Andover-based Emelie is a senior studying 6-9, Computation and Cognition with a concentration in Comparitive Media Studies. Her passion for, and work in, fashion has influenced her hope of positively impacting the world through wearble devices. From coxing on the Charles each morning to breaking boards in Tang Soo Do, Emelie wants to bring athletic competitive elements to her designs as well. She's extremely excited to learn more about the evolution of design and how to incorporate psychology into her work through CMS.405.
