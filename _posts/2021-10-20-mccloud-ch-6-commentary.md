In this chapter, it was interesting to see the transformation of how humans have used text and imagery. McCloud described the various approaches to combining the two together. It was interesting for me to observe the various ways I can utilize text and images to create a certain message. One of the points that really pulled me in was how text and images can help finish each other's meanings, be independent from each other, supplement a broader idea, etc. I think this topic will be important to consider for my future projects as I can utilize one or both to create a certain feeling and meaning simultaneously. I think I can explore approaching text less literally when using it with images. It is easy to just choose the shared meaning between image and text as opposed to experimenting with parallel combinations, which are less straightforward.
