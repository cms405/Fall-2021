In my commentary, I'm addressing some of the comments by my colleagues. A common theme is a distinction between how viewers perceive photographs. Barthes expressed, "A photograph is always invisible: it is not that we see." According to the author, there are two ways to perceive photos: critical and the other is expressive. We can see that through the examples he provides and how each has its own meaning. That view in photography stems from the fact that Barthes is not a trained photographer. Technique and rule-based photography is not part of his approach. Barthe's approach is more about what's being photographed than it is "how to photograph".
