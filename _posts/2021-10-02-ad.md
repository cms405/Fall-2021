ad

In this proposed ad design, I used conceptual metaphors and blending to signal the dangers associated with drinking alcohol. I chose an image of a popular figure on a stage drinking beer while his daughter was holding to his legs. I chose this moment as it portrays an organic interaction and a memory that people would like to remember; it showed a happy snapshot in someone's life. That moment is what we see as viewers, a person on a stage holding a beer. A stage is not a place to be drinking beer; it must have been an advertisement in which the public figure endorsed that type of beer.

ad campaign that inspired my idea

I wanted to blend an ad campaign about alcohol awareness with this raw moment. I chose to show that while we see a person on a stage holding beer, the alcohol damages the things we don't see. I did that by blending the organs to the male figure in the image, emphasizing the hidden areas that are being affected. I leveraged that the figure was holding a beer and used that brand as the logo in my ad. I blurred and reduced the colors of the moment on stage to point viewers' attention to the organs and the message of the campaign. 


The ad I'm proposing could be a concept that's part of an anti-alcohol awareness campaign. The idea is to show a happy moment of people drinking alcohol then emphasizing the damage done to the hidden parts of our body. While alcohol is damaging, the idea of growing sick and tired and not be able to help your kids is a metaphor of helplessness and failure that might be triggering. I chose a moment in which a person is with his daughter to trigger more emotions in my ad.
