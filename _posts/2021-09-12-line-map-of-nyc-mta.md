This poster abstracts New York City's public transit system into pure lines and dots. It's compelling because despite not saying it directly, it immediately evokes one of NYC's most iconic features, and has a minimialist appeal to it. People can be reminded of memory and the more detailed map through the simple beauty of this poster.
