In chapter 6, MaCloud discussed the beautiful relationship between pictures and words. He explained the critical effect that words have on pictures. According to him, words may distract from the signals in the picture, or they might provide us with a richer message full of expression. The decision to use words and pictures depends on the author's direction and vision. Leaving pictures with no words shows the reader a moment in the comic left to their interpretations. From our previous readings, I feel leaving out words and using pictures only is a brilliant idea. A great example is the Chicago Tribune ad campaign. If we think about it, it's easier to say that a person is angry, but it's much harder to show that, especially in comics.
