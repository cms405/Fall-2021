This painting by Damien Hirst uses colorful dots and white linear negative space. It is compelling as it uses the grid arrangement of the round dots to form a line of its own against the white background. It also uses the simplicity of dots and lines to allow the viewer to enjoy the colors of the art piece. All of the colors can join together harmoniously within this piece, which makes this art piece particularly effective.
