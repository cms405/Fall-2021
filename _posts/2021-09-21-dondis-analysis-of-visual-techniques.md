In today's discussion, I'll be focusing on four techniques, the juxtaposition between fragmentation vs. unity, and understatement vs. exaggeration. For the former, it's striking to see the similarity to Gestalt principles where parts can come together to form an unified whole. While unity often creates a Zen-like feel of satisfaction, fragmententation creates a sense of wonder and inquisition. This is seen potently through the work of Micaela Lattanzio, an artist who cuts portraits into miniscule pieces and re-assembles them into a unique composition. In particular, the physical fragmentation also manifests in this piece to represent the metaphorical fragmentation of the person's identity.
For the latter, understatement vs. exaggeration is also an effective modality for visual design. In particular, both can serve to provide critical underlying commentary on the basis of technique. For example, in a world of constant information overload, understatement-based ads in particular can serve as a breath of fresh air and also push the viewer to think deeply about the issue at hand. For instance, this is seen in the following WWF for Nature ad, which powerfully shows how the current exploitation of the ecosystem is resulting in devastating effects on marine animals. On the flip side, exaggeration is also frequently seen in print advertisements, as seen with the Cheeze-it ad. In doing so, the ad uses exaggeration to emphasize the intense flavor packed in the small square-shaped snack.
