title: Tufte Chapter 5 Color and Information
author: Annie Zhang

Reading Tufte's chapter on "Color and Information", I think Tufte makes a really interesting point when he lists the two requirements which would make using multiple signals effective (ie. the need for it and the appropriate choice of design technique). This framework for deciding when to use multiple signals to encode the same information would be really helpful to apply to our own designs, not just for mapmaking. Just looking at the examples, it seems like the strategy of multiple signals can create a really sturdy design/communication but at the same time has the potential to go too far and clutter the design space. These ideas reminded me of the Spiekerman reading on typography. Similar to how it is helpful to use different types in order to convey different meanings or personalities but to keep in mind that too many different types can be visually confusing, too many different colors and signals may work to communicate more ineffectively. Additionally, when Tufte discusses Byrne's colors in "Elements of Euclid", especially when he talks about using 4 colors that provide maximum differentiation, it also reminded me of the Spiekerman reading and readers were able to match different fonts with different shoes/personalities.
