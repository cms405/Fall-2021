In this reading, Tufte incisively discusses the capacity for thoughtful use of color to effectively capture information in design. Similar to Dondis's analysis, Tufte describes how color choice impacts the overall message of a design, however, does not delve into the intricacies of Dondis where they describe the effect of changes in hue, saturation, brightness, etc. Rather, the core of Tufte's argument is that, "The fundamental uses of color in information design (are): to label, to measure, to represent or imitate reality, to enliven or decorate." He structures the chapter by going through principles established by Eduard Imhob in __Cartographic Relief Presentation__. The first two principles discuss the minimization of color damage by avoiding color clutter, where bright and light colors are placed closely adjacent to each other. The use of loud colors overwhelms the viewer and adds noise to the design, harming it's ability to effectively communicate with the audience. Tufte points out that the use of primary colors with neutral colors is therefore especially effective as they provide maximum differentiation. The third principle describe the use gray in design as it is "the prettiest and most versatile of colors" highlighting brighter colors and consequently highlighting information.
