Out of all of the visual communication techniques Dondis mentions in chapter 6, the ones that caught my attention the most were depth, activeness, spontaneity, and simplicity.

Depth adds perspective, it allows the viewer to put the design in an environmental context. It is interesting how dimension is understood through the use of light and dark and makes the piece closer to imitating life. 

As a dancer myself, I always appreciate movement in design. Activeness reflects this motion through elements that suggest energy and life. This makes designs more dynamic and entrancing by setting a scene.

Spontaneity is impulsive and free. This sense of liberty is directly related to expressing emotion more thoroughly through design. With this technique, the viewer can truly follow the designer’s stream of consciousness in the piece.

Simplicity alludes to the concept of “less is more”. Sometimes a message can be most clearly expressed by stripping it down to core elements that channel directness and singleness. This sense of order removes complications and overly elaborate details and focuses solely on the message or feeling the designer is trying to get across.
