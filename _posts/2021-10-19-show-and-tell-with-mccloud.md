As usual, I strongly appreciate how the format complements the content in Understanding Comics. It’s interesting to be able to analyze the format of the book itself with the content of the chapter itself, seeing the different ways McCloud interplays the text and image, even though he normally relies on text to explain more complicated details. The relationships between the text and image that McCloud applies to comics can also be directly applied to thinking about visual design, as most designs include both pictures and words working with each other to communicate something. Perhaps the most interesting thing that McCloud does that I can apply to my own practice is fixing one of the two elements and seeing what that enables in terms of freedom to experiment. While often visual design makes sure the image and text match each other, when one is communicating the primary message the other can reinforce it in more experimental ways, which is something I want to play around more with. While its much harder to do in a clean way compared to comics, I do also think there’s some elements of storytelling that can be worked into my design more than they currently are.
