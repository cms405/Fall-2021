Subway maps are a prime example of lines and dots coming together to form a cohesive and useful message. Through the intricacies of the lengths and curves of the lines, the viewer is able to get a sense of each path and how they all connect. Moreover, the varying sizes of dots communicate the importance of each stop, with spots with overlapping lines being larger than the average stop dot.
