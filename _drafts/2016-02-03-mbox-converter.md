Here's a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akstuhl/mboxtocsv) with a simple script you can run to turn an .mbox file, the format your emails are exported to, into a .csv file, which you can view as a spreadsheet. Instructions for how to install and use it are included in the repository's home page.
